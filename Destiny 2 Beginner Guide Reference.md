# [Analysis: Destiny 2 Guide for 2020 / New Light & Shadowkeep Tips for New Players (27:54) // [Anamana!]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpoyS0PFZc4)

## At A Glance:
- Video is a detailed guide for absolute beginners
- Covers *every single system* in Destiny 2 accompanied with brief verbal explanation
- The video narrated by a male, human voice
- Topics lasts 1 ~ 2 minutes
- Topics are tangentially related
  - e.g.: Director -> Traveler -> Bounty -> Loot -> Equipment -> Light Level
- Minimal editing
  - Background footage of relevant systems or general combat
  - Unintrusive overlay of PFP and image
- Heavy scriptwriting
  - Seamless transition from one topic to next, always tangential and concise

Video requires minimal editing with a lot of scriptwriting, it can cover so many topics because there is a voice narration. The audio quality is high but the narration is sometimes unclear, with mistakes in editing (volume boom or loss) and pronunciation. The narrative tone is concise, efficient, semi-friendly. </br></br> 285k views in 6 months.
