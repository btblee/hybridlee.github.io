</ul>
<p>Video requires minimal editing with a lot of scriptwriting, it can cover so many topics because there is a voice narration. The audio quality is high but the narration is sometimes unclear, with mistakes in editing (volume boom or loss) and pronunciation. The narrative tone is concise, efficient, semi-friendly. </br></br> 285k views in 6 months.</p>
